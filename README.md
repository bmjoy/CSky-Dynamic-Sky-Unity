# Some known problems
- There is a problem in the calculations of the sidereal time in the calculations of the celestial bodies, this causes that the position of the moon and stars is not exact, this problem will be solved later on.

- When an element of the skysphere is selected to be reflected in the reflection probe, the skybox is not reflected.

# Future
If I receive enough support in patreon, the asset will receive updates more regularly, if not, it will probably take longer. at the moment I am working with godot since for some reasons I can only work in linux at the moment.

# Realistic Clouds, Procedural Stars Field, Curve And Gradient System will come in the future
